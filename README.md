Utilizing Two Orchestrators: Docker Swarm &amp; Kubernetes (TO_DSK)

Docker Swarm, by default, prioritizes isolation between containers. This is construed by some to represent higher security.

Kubernetes prioritizes communication between multiple containers in the same pod. This is construed by some to represent lower security.

Depending upon the preference, Kubernetes apps can be migrated to Docker Swarm, and vice versa.

Depending upon the requirement, the choice of orchestrator (i.e., Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) can be made.
